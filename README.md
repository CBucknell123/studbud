# Desktop landing page

When coding the desktop landing page I tried to make my layout as similar as possible to the initial proposed design as possible which I succeeded in doing by using layout.it to create the layout that I used for the proposed design. I made sure that different parts of the page didnt stretch out and look strange as this is a problem that I ran into at the start. However some sacrifices were made from my initial design which I still want to be in the final design but could not figure out how to do it. These were the kanban being able to function properly and have a drag and drop feature between the three kanban columns and the completed row. This was definitely my worst part of the prototype and I tried many times to get it working but in the end I had to settle with placeholder divs and the interactive task list used as a basic basis to show what I wanted to achieve.

# Mobile landing page

The mobile layout was a simple matter of working out how to get the kanban columns to stack onto each other. I was fairly daunted by this because I was fairly unsuccessful in my last attempt at doing it but through much research I figured out that I could make the layout completely change to make it one column instead of three at a certain threshold. Once I worked this out I tweaked some margins and it was working very smoothly. I was very happy with how the mobile landing page turned out in the end.

# Desktop study room page

This design took a serious overhaul from my initial design where the stopwatch, dictionary and music player are dropdown options in the header to being seperate rows in the page. This was done of course due to a lack of technical proficiency of how to do this so the decision was to redesign the layout to be as easy as possible to code for and get as much functionality in each component. But even though I could not recreate my initial design I was very happy with what I ended up with as the floating block aesthetic from the landing page was carried over with the same buttons to create consistency in the design and all of the features work very well. But this did take lots of time to get the styling right as each feature was drastically different from the other but I was quite happy with the way this page turned out.

Overrall not much iteration for the mobile layout of this page was needed as each row didn't have seperate columns but the only unsuccessful part of the page is the stopwatch spilling out of its box to the right when adjusted past a certain point which I tried to fix but could not work out. But I was very happy with the music player as it is always at a consistent size throughout when it is scaled and the use of the spotify embed makes it look very professional.

# Removed sign-up/login page

Ultimately I decided to remove the sign up and login page as I felt its addition was superfluous and didnt actually add any value to the page. So having it there would be just another obstacle for both me to code and the potential user as it wasnt actually a necessary feature.
